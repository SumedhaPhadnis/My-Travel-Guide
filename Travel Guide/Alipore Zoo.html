            The Zoological Garden, Alipore is India's oldest formally stated zoological park and a big tourist attraction in Kolkata. 
            It has been open as a zoo since 1876, and covers 18.811 ha .
            It is probably best known as the home of the now expired Aldabra giant tortoise Adwaita, who was reputed to have been over 250 years old when he died in 2006.
            It is also home to one of the few captive breeding projects involving the Manipur brow-antlered deer.
