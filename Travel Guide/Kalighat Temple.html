                A popular religious attraction of Kolkata, Kalighat Kali Temple is considered as one of the 52 Shakti Peethas (places where the various parts of Sati's body are believed to have fallen, in the course of Shiva's Rudra Tandava) of India. 
                Kalighat is said to be the site where the toes of the right foot of Sati fell.

                The temple is located in South Kolkata.
